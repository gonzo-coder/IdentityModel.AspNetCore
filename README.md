# IdentityModel.AspNetCore.Password
ASP.NET Core helper library managing user and client access tokens in ASP.NET Core.

With Password Grant.

Original lib will never support Password Grant:
https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.AspNetCore/issues/92

But I can't persuade some third party web API providers not to use Password Grant.
